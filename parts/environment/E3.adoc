=== (E.3) Constraints

The development of the Large Event Management System (LEMS) is subject to a number of
environmental and organizational constraints that must be observed throughout the project.
These constraints are considered non-negotiable and define the limits within which the system must operate.

Business and Organizational Constraints:

* The system must comply with McMaster University policies for student organizations, including financial tracking and data management expectations.
* Payment processing must be handled through approved providers (Stripe) to ensure compliance with institutional and financial regulations.
* Data collected from participants must follow privacy and confidentiality rules, with secure handling of personal information and waivers.
* The system must remain maintainable beyond the current project team, supporting future MES groups with minimal retraining.

Technical and Infrastructure Constraints:

* The backend must use PostgreSQL as the database technology, as specified by project leadership.
* Hosting will be provided through DigitalOcean, managed by the MES, which limits available deployment platforms.
* Containerization with Docker will be used for database instances, and this approach must be maintained to simplify deployment and consistency across groups.
* The chosen technology stack (JavaScript, Next.js, React Native, NestJS, Drizzle ORM) must be consistently applied across groups to avoid integration issues.

Operational Constraints:

* The system must be able to support peak usage during major events such as the Fireball Formal or Graffiti Pub, where hundreds of concurrent sign-ups and check-ins may occur.
* Interfaces must be usable on both web and mobile platforms, as attendees will expect access from their own devices.
* The project must be completed within the academic term schedule, which limits available time for development, testing, and deployment.

These constraints ensure that the system respects institutional rules, technical choices, and practical limits of the development environment. They set the boundaries within which design decisions can be made.
