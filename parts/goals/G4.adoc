The MacSync Application provides a centralized platform for McMaster Engineering Society (MES) to host large-scale events. Listed below is a high-level overview and relevancy of the functional and non-functional requirements integral to the sytem.

==== Functional Requirements

- *Payments / Ticketing:* The application must integrate a payment gateway to create charges for event tickets. Each transaction should generate an invoice for the attendee and a sales report for system admin. Furthermore,  The gateway should be able to handle real-time availability checks to prevent overselling tickets.
- *Role / Feature Based Access Control (RBAC/FBAC):* The system must provide access to various features depending on users privelege level. This will also include an admin UI to assign/revoke roles. This will ensure a clear seperation of use-cases for end users.
- *Bus / RSVP / Table Signups:* The system must provide an RSVP feature for students to automatically sign-up, the system will show live capacity information (i.e. the number of spots left). In the event that many users try to sign up at the same time, the system will ensure tickets are given out on a first-come first-serve basis to ensure fairness for users to register and prevent over selling tickets.

==== Key Functional Requirements

- *End-to-End Registration:* The full registration system including the payments, RSVP sign-ups, generated analytics and registration forms is the key component of the MacSync platform. It provides the full end-to-end solution for users to sign up for MES events and stands as the flag ship feature of the application.

==== Non-Functional Requirements

- *Privacy & Security:* The system must comply with regulations such as PIPEDA and/or PCI-DSS. Students will be providing personal information to create their MacSync platform profiles and be providing payment information to purchase tickets. The application must be able to ensure that any senstive information is protected.
- *Data-Integrity & Consistency:* The system must be able to have strong consistency in the event of concurrent transactional operations. This ensures that events arent over sold with limited capacity in the instance where many users are attempting to register at the same time.
