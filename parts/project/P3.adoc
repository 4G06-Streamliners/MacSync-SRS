At the end of sprint 2 we will have developed the core features for the sign-ups and login. With these 2 features we will be able to show our stakeholders a proof of concept demo to get early feedback for further development. By sprint 4 we will have developed the payment gateway and integrating all the components together to produce a MVP to be tested and deployed. This will be an early access application to get feedback from users what they think of the app and how we can further the event registration experience.
