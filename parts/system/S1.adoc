The system relies on the following **software components**:

* **Registration & Ticketing Module** :: Provides functionality for attendees to view upcoming events, purchase tickets, join waitlists, and confirm registration.
* **Payment Processing Module** :: Interfaces with third-party gateways (Stripe, Square, PayPal) to process transactions securely and issue confirmations.
* **Waiver & Preference Module** :: Collects required liability waivers and optional attendee information (dietary restrictions, accessibility needs).
* **Bus/Table/RSVP Module** :: Manages sign-ups for buses, table seating, and session RSVPs, enforcing capacity limits and fairness in assignment.
* **Check-In Module** :: Validates digital tickets via QR/Barcode scanning, including offline validation support for unreliable connectivity.
* **Notification & Reminder Module** :: Sends push notifications, confirmations, and event reminders through integrated services (e.g., Calendar Integration).
* **Admin Dashboard & Analytics Module** :: Provides organizers with an interface to monitor registrations, ticket sales, waitlists, finances, and demographic data.
* **Role-Based / Feature-Based Access Control Module (RBAC/FBAC)** :: Ensures organizers only access features and data relevant to their role.
* **Database Management System** :: Stores user accounts, ticketing data, waiver records, payment confirmations, and system logs.
* **Audit Logging Subsystem** :: Records all administrative actions (refunds, seat assignments, event edits) for accountability and traceability.

The system relies on the following **hardware components**:

* **Mobile Devices (iOS/Android smartphones)** :: Used by attendees to register, purchase tickets, receive notifications, and check in to events.
* **Laptops/Desktops (Organizers)** :: Used by MES volunteers and executives to access the admin dashboard, manage events, and perform analytics.
* **QR Code Scanners (Smartphone Cameras or Organizer Devices)** :: Used at event entrances to validate attendee tickets efficiently.
* **Cloud Hosting Infrastructure** :: Provides servers for backend processing, database management, and load balancing during peak demand.

Together, these components define the operational structure of the system and highlight the dependencies critical for secure and reliable operation.
