=== (S.6) Verification and acceptance criteria

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Specification of the conditions under which an implementation will be deemed satisfactory. Here, "verification" as shorthand for what is more explicitly called "Verification & Validation" (V&V), covering several levels of testing — module testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing — as well as other techniques such as static analysis and, when applicable, program proving._  <<BM22>>

The verification and acceptance process for the Large Event Management System (LEMS) defines how both functional and non-functional requirements will be validated and accepted.  
Verification confirms that the system has been built correctly according to specifications, while validation confirms that the right system has been built to meet MES organizers’ and attendees’ needs.

==== Functional Requirements

**1. Validation Approach**  
Functional requirements will be verified through **acceptance testing**, automated test frameworks, and **user validation sessions** with MES organizers.  
Prototypes of each core feature (Payment, RBAC/FBAC, Registration, Sign-Ups, Notifications) will be delivered to stakeholders during iterative sprints.  
Each feature will be validated against acceptance criteria defined in the SRS and approved by both MES and the course supervisor.

Verification will include the following methods:  
* **Module (Unit) Testing:** Each functional module is tested independently (e.g., payment API, seat assignment logic).  
* **Integration Testing:** Ensures interactions between modules (e.g., successful payment triggers ticket confirmation).  
* **System Testing:** Full workflow validation — from registration to check-in — simulating real MES event scenarios.  
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** MES organizers and selected student users perform hands-on validation of workflows.

|===
| **Functional Area** | **Verification and Acceptance Criteria**

| **F1 – Payment System** | 
All transactions are processed securely via Stripe, Square, or PayPal APIs.  
System confirms payment completion, issues confirmation email/QR ticket, and prevents duplicate transactions.  
Passes integration test and UAT with 100% successful payment-to-ticket generation.  

| **F2 – Role-Based / Feature-Based Access Control (RBAC/FBAC)** |
Users can log in with McMaster SSO credentials.  
Organizers have access only to event management functions, while attendees have restricted access.  
All unauthorized attempts are logged and rejected during testing.  

| **F3 – Registration, Waivers, and Preferences** |
Users can register for events, complete digital waivers, and enter dietary/accessibility preferences.  
All required forms validate correctly and are stored in the database.  
Acceptance confirmed by organizers through UAT checklist.  

| **F4 – Bus/Table/RSVP Sign-Ups** |
System enforces real-time capacity limits.  
Users receive confirmation of seat/bus/table assignment.  
Test passes when 100% of sign-ups remain within defined capacity thresholds.  

| **F5 – Notifications and Reminders** |
Push notifications and confirmation emails are sent successfully upon registration and prior to events.  
Testing confirms that 95% of notifications are delivered within 5 minutes of event trigger.  

| **F6 – Calendar Integration** |
Events can be added directly to Google, Apple, or Outlook calendars via ICS export.  
Calendar entries include correct event name, time, and location.  
Acceptance confirmed via UAT on multiple calendar platforms.

==== Non-Functional Requirements

Verification and validation of non-functional requirements will ensure that the system’s **security, performance, accessibility, reliability, and usability** meet the defined standards and user expectations.  
Testing will be performed through automated performance tests, accessibility audits, and manual review sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria for Non-Functional Requirements:**
[cols="1,4", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| **Non-Functional Category** | **Verification and Acceptance Criteria**

| **NF1 – Accessibility** | 
Interface verified for compliance with **AODA and WCAG 2.1 AA** standards using accessibility testing tools.  
Usability sessions with students of varied needs confirm all functions are operable without barriers.  

| **NF2 – Security and Privacy** | 
Data encryption verified via static analysis and penetration testing.  
All sensitive information encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256).  
Access control verified to prevent privilege escalation.  
No unencrypted personal or payment data detected in code review or runtime logs.  

| **NF3 – Performance and Reliability** | 
Load testing confirms that 1,000 concurrent users can register or pay without failures.  
Average response time ≤ 2 seconds, uptime ≥ 98% during simulated registration peaks.  
Offline QR check-in functions successfully for at least 60 minutes without connectivity.  

| **NF4 – Backup and Recovery** | 
Automated daily backups verified and test restoration completed within 24 hours.  
Recovery drills demonstrate data integrity ≥ 99.9% post-restore.  

| **NF5 – Usability and User Satisfaction** | 
UAT survey results show ≥ 80% satisfaction for ease-of-use and visual clarity.  
Core actions (register, pay, check-in) achievable in ≤ 3 clicks/taps.  

| **NF6 – Compliance and Maintainability** | 
System adheres to PCI-DSS (for payments), PIPEDA (privacy), and internal MES guidelines.  
Source code passes linting/static analysis with zero critical errors.  
Documentation and test coverage ≥ 90% for core modules.

==== Traceability and Acceptance Procedure
1. **Requirement Traceability:** Each functional and non-functional requirement in the SRS is linked to one or more test cases in the V&V plan.  
2. **Testing Evidence:** Test results, performance logs, and accessibility audit reports will be stored in the project repository.  
3. **Stakeholder Review:** MES organizers and course supervisors will validate successful completion during UAT and Capstone demonstrations.  
4. **Final Acceptance:** The system will be deemed accepted when all mandatory requirements meet or exceed defined acceptance criteria, verified results are documented, and formal sign-off is received from both MES and the course supervisor.
