=== (S.6) Verification and Acceptance Criteria

==== Validation of Functional Requirements

To validate the functional requirements of the MacSync system, the team will perform module, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT).  

* **Module testing** will verify that each component listed in <<s1>> performs its defined behavior independently.  
* **Integration testing** will ensure seamless communication between frontend and backend modules.  
* **System testing** will confirm end-to-end behavior, focusing on registration, payment, and analytics workflows.  
* **User acceptance testing** will involve MES stakeholders performing real registration scenarios to confirm usability and correctness.

==== Fit Criteria for Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** Core actions such as registration or payment confirmation shall respond within *2 seconds* under normal load.  
* **Scalability:** The backend shall handle *500 concurrent users* without more than *10 percent* performance degradation.  
* **Reliability:** Overall system uptime shall be *99 percent* during major event periods.  
* **Security:** All user and payment data shall be encrypted with TLS 1.3 and stored following PCI-DSS and PIPEDA compliance.  
* **Usability:** The registration process shall require *no more than three steps* and yield a *90 percent task-success rate* in UAT.  
* **Notification timeliness:** Confirmation emails and in-app messages shall be delivered within *60 seconds* of completed registration.

==== Selected Scenario for Testing

The scenario *Register for an Event* (<<s4>>) is selected as the primary validation case since it exercises the full registration and payment workflow.

===== Proposed Tests for "Register for an Event"

1. **Registration Workflow Test**  
- Objective: Verify that users can complete event registration from selection to confirmation.  
- Procedure: Simulate a logged-in user selecting an event, filling the form, and completing payment.  
- Expected Outcome: The system confirms registration, issues a QR code ticket, and sends notifications.

2. **Payment Processing Test**  
- Objective: Validate correct Stripe integration and recording of payment confirmations.  
- Procedure: Execute sandbox transactions and verify backend receipt of success callbacks.  
- Expected Outcome: Transaction details are saved and ticket marked “Paid”.

3. **Waitlist Handling Test**  
- Objective: Ensure users are queued when capacity is reached.  
- Procedure: Attempt registration after capacity is full.  
- Expected Outcome: User is added to waitlist and notified of position.

4. **Error and Retry Test**  
- Objective: Confirm proper recovery from payment or connection failures.  
- Procedure: Interrupt payment midway and retry.  
- Expected Outcome: Clear retry message; no duplicate transaction recorded.

5. **Notification Delivery Test**  
- Objective: Confirm that users receive confirmation messages promptly.  
- Procedure: Check email logs and in-app notification queue post-registration.  
- Expected Outcome: Notifications delivered within 60 seconds.
