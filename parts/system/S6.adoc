=== (S.6) Verification and Acceptance Criteria

==== Validation of Functional Requirements

To validate the functional requirements of the MacSync system, the team will perform module, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT).  

* **Module testing** will verify that each component listed in <<s1>> performs its defined behavior independently.  
* **Integration testing** will ensure seamless communication between frontend and backend modules.  
* **System testing** will confirm end-to-end behavior, focusing on registration, payment, and analytics workflows.  
* **User acceptance testing** will involve MES stakeholders performing real registration scenarios to confirm usability and correctness.

==== Fit Criteria for Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** Core actions such as registration or payment confirmation shall respond within *2 seconds* under normal load.  
* **Scalability:** The backend shall handle *500 concurrent users* without more than *10 percent* performance degradation.  
* **Reliability:** Overall system uptime shall be *99 percent* during major event periods.  
* **Security:** All user and payment data shall be encrypted with TLS 1.3 and stored following PCI-DSS and PIPEDA compliance.  
* **Usability:** The registration process shall require *no more than three steps* and yield a *90 percent task-success rate* in UAT.  
* **Notification timeliness:** Confirmation emails and in-app messages shall be delivered within *60 seconds* of completed registration.

==== Selected Scenario for Testing

The scenario *Register for an Event* (<<s4>>) is selected as the primary validation case since it exercises the full registration and payment workflow.

===== Proposed Tests for "Register for an Event"

1. **Registration Workflow Test**  
- Objective: Verify that users can complete event registration from selection to confirmation.  
- Procedure: Simulate a logged-in user selecting an event, filling the form, and completing payment.  
- Expected Outcome: The system confirms registration, issues a QR code ticket, and sends notifications.

2. **Payment Processing Test**  
- Objective: Validate correct Stripe integration and recording of payment confirmations.  
- Procedure: Execute sandbox transactions and verify backend receipt of success callbacks.  
- Expected Outcome: Transaction details are saved and ticket marked “Paid”.

3. **Waitlist Handling Test**  
- Objective: Ensure users are queued when capacity is reached.  
- Procedure: Attempt registration after capacity is full.  
- Expected Outcome: User is added to waitlist and notified of position.

4. **Error and Retry Test**  
- Objective: Confirm proper recovery from payment or connection failures.  
- Procedure: Interrupt payment midway and retry.  
- Expected Outcome: Clear retry message; no duplicate transaction recorded.

5. **Notification Delivery Test**  
- Objective: Confirm that users receive confirmation messages promptly.  
- Procedure: Check email logs and in-app notification queue post-registration.  
- Expected Outcome: Notifications delivered within 60 seconds.

The verification and acceptance process for the Large Event Management System (LEMS) defines how both functional and non-functional requirements will be validated and accepted.  
Verification confirms that the system has been built correctly according to specifications, while validation confirms that the right system has been built to meet MES organizers’ and attendees’ needs.

==== Functional Requirements

**1. Validation Approach**  
Functional requirements will be verified through **acceptance testing**, automated test frameworks, and **user validation sessions** with MES organizers.  
Prototypes of each core feature (Payment, RBAC/FBAC, Registration, Sign-Ups, Notifications) will be delivered to stakeholders during iterative sprints.  
Each feature will be validated against acceptance criteria defined in the SRS and approved by both MES and the course supervisor.

Verification will include the following methods:  
* **Module (Unit) Testing:** Each functional module is tested independently (e.g., payment API, seat assignment logic).  
* **Integration Testing:** Ensures interactions between modules (e.g., successful payment triggers ticket confirmation).  
* **System Testing:** Full workflow validation — from registration to check-in — simulating real MES event scenarios.  
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** MES organizers and selected student users perform hands-on validation of workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria for Functional Requirements:**

|===
| **Functional Area** | **Verification and Acceptance Criteria**

| **F1 – Payment System** | 
All transactions are processed securely via a payment gateway such as Stripe, Square, or PayPal APIs.  
System confirms payment completion, issues confirmation email/QR ticket, and prevents duplicate transactions.  
Passes integration test and UAT with 100% successful payment-to-ticket generation.  

| **F2 – Role-Based / Feature-Based Access Control (RBAC/FBAC)** |
Users can log in with McMaster SSO credentials.  
Organizers have access only to event management functions, while attendees have restricted access.  
All unauthorized attempts are logged and rejected during testing.  

| **F3 – Registration, Waivers, and Preferences** |
Users can register for events, complete digital waivers, and enter dietary/accessibility preferences.  
All required forms validate correctly and are stored in the database.  
Acceptance confirmed by organizers through UAT checklist.  

| **F4 – Bus/Table/RSVP Sign-Ups** |
System enforces real-time capacity limits.  
Users receive confirmation of seat/bus/table assignment.  
Test passes when 100% of sign-ups remain within defined capacity thresholds.  

| **F5 – Notifications and Reminders** |
Push notifications and confirmation emails are sent successfully upon registration and prior to events.

==== Non-Functional Requirements

Verification and validation of non-functional requirements will ensure that the system’s **security, performance, accessibility, reliability, and usability** meet the defined standards and user expectations.  
Testing will be performed through automated performance tests, accessibility audits, and manual review sessions.
