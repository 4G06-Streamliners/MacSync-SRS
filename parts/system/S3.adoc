TIP: _How the system makes the functionality of <<s2>> available to the rest of the world, particularly user interfaces and program interfaces (APIs). It specifies how that functionality will be made available to the rest of the world, including people (users) and other systems. These are interfaces provided by the system to the outside; the other way around, interfaces from other systems, which the system may use, are specified in <<e2>>._  <<BM22>>

The MES system offers several external interfaces, which facilitate interaction with both users and external systems. This section details the external APIs provided by each core component of the system. These APIs enable key functionalities for the platform such as user navigation, payment system interaction, access control, event management and sign-ups.
